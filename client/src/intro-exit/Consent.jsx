          I agree to participate in a research study conducted by the
          Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In order to analyze responses
          to the questionnaire, my answers will be recorded. No identifying
          information about me will be made public and any views I express will
          be kept completely confidential. Findings from this study will be
          reported in scholarly journals, at academic seminars, and at research
          association meetings. The data will be stored at a secured location
          and retained indefinitely. My participation is voluntary. I am free to
          withdraw from the study at any time. Should you have questions, please
